                <h2>About T-eco-evo</h2>
                <p>This research group started off in April 2016 and is embedded in the <a href="http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/16397/group_evolutionarytheory"> Department of Theoretical Biology </a> at the  <a href="http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en">Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology</a>. </p>
                <p>The focus of this group is to explore the ecological as well as evolutionary processes underpinning biological phenomena.</p>
                <p>Focal topics include, eco-evolutionary game dynamics and its application to social evolution, antagonistic interactions patters (host-parasite, predator-prey relationships) and symbiotic intereactions (mutualisms, between and within species).</p>
